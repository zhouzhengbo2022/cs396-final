We did research on a few concepts that were not covered before. Such as WCC stands for:Weakly connected components. And a weakly connected component is a maximal subgraph of a directed graph such that for every pair of vertices u&v in the subgraph, there is an undirected path from u to v, and a directed path from v to u. And the SCC stands for Strongly connected components. A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices.And a strongly connected component is maximal subgraph of a directed graph such that for every pair of vertices u&v in the subgraph, there is a directed path from u to v, and a directed path from v to u. And we also generated a scratch graph that shows the Amazon product co-purchasing network from June 1 2003. And we also found that there are more edges than nodes in this network. And we discovered that the longest shortest path shows us how wide the network is. Considering there are so many nodes and edges, this diameter is not that bad. And closed triangles are way less than regular triangles in the network. And we listed out a few questions we wanted to answer. And we introduced our approaches to resolve the issue we listed including methods in visualization, different metrics, and had run different social network models.
